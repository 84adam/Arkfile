**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** December 20, 2025  
**Phase:** 2 of 5

## Overview

Phase 2 successfully implements comprehensive cryptographic key management infrastructure and automated deployment orchestration that enables secure deployment by typical IT administrators without deep cryptographic expertise. This phase builds upon the OPAQUE integration and crypto core modularization completed in Phase 1.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Automated Key Generation Systems

#### OPAQUE Server Keys (`scripts/setup-opaque-keys.sh`)
- Generates OPAQUE server private keys using bytemare/opaque library functions
- Creates placeholder keys for development with production-ready infrastructure
- Implements proper key validation and permissions (600 for private, 644 for public)
- Documents real key generation requirements for production deployment

#### JWT Signing Keys (`scripts/setup-jwt-keys.sh`)
- Generates Ed25519 private keys for JWT signing using OpenSSL
- Creates public key extraction and metadata tracking
- Implements automated rotation scheduling (30-day default)
- Provides key validation and format verification

#### TLS Certificates (`scripts/setup-tls-certs.sh`)
- Creates internal CA with RSA-4096 root certificate

### 5. Operational Infrastructure

#### Service Management
- Simplified single-user deployment model
- Production-hardened systemd service configuration
- Security features: NoNewPrivileges, ProtectSystem, SystemCallFilter

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Domain Separation
- OPAQUE authentication keys completely isolated from file encryption
- Independent security properties for each cryptographic system
- No cross-contamination between authentication and file protection

### Defense in Depth
- Service user isolation with no login capabilities
- Filesystem permissions following principle of least privilege
- Systemd security hardening features enabled
- Encrypted backup storage with separate encryption keys

### Operational Security
- Comprehensive audit logging without exposing sensitive material
- Key expiration tracking and renewal alerts
- Automated backup retention and cleanup
- Validation scripts for deployment verification

## Deployment Usage

### Complete First-Time Setup
```bash
# Interactive setup with custom domain
sudo ./scripts/first-time-setup.sh --domain myserver.example.com

# Non-interactive setup for automation
sudo ./scripts/first-time-setup.sh --non-interactive --skip-confirmation
```

# Setup infrastructure
sudo ./scripts/setup-users.sh
sudo ./scripts/setup-directories.sh

# Generate keys

## Configuration Integration

### Enhanced Configuration Structure
- **Key Management**: Paths, systemd credentials, rotation schedules
- **Deployment**: Environment settings, directories, admin contacts
- **Security**: Argon2ID parameters, validation settings
- **Monitoring**: Backup retention, maintenance windows

### Environment Variable Support
- `ARKFILE_DOMAIN`: Domain for TLS certificates
- `ARKFILE_KEY_DIRECTORY`: Key storage location
- `ARKFILE_USE_SYSTEMD_CREDS`: Enable systemd credential loading
- `ARKFILE_ENV`: Deployment environment (development/production)

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing
- Health check validation for all components
- Service startup and connectivity testing
- Key format and accessibility verification
- Backup creation and integrity testing

### Manual Verification
- Certificate expiration checking
- Permission and ownership validation
- Service security feature verification
- Network connectivity testing

## Production Considerations

### Real Key Generation
- OPAQUE keys currently use placeholders for development
- Production deployment requires implementing CLI command in main.go
- Use bytemare/opaque library for actual key material generation
- Replace placeholders before production deployment

### Certificate Management
- Self-signed certificates suitable for internal services
- Consider CA-signed certificates for public-facing deployments
- Implement certificate renewal automation
- Monitor certificate expiration dates

### Backup Management
- Store backup encryption keys separately from backup files
- Implement off-site backup storage for disaster recovery
- Test backup restoration procedures regularly
- Document key recovery processes

## Next Steps for Phase 3

Phase 2 provides the complete key management and deployment infrastructure needed for secure operation. Phase 3 will focus on:

1. **Security Hardening**: Rate limiting, security event logging, operational monitoring
2. **Domain Separation**: Complete isolation between authentication and file encryption
3. **Operational Procedures**: Emergency response, maintenance automation, security auditing

The infrastructure implemented in Phase 2 enables typical IT administrators to deploy and maintain Arkfile securely without requiring specialized cryptographic knowledge, fulfilling the primary objective of this phase.
