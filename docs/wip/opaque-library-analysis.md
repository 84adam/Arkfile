- **Maintenance**: Actively maintained
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows IRTF CFRG OPAQUE specification
- **Dependencies**: libsodium, liboprf (bundled)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite, all tests passing

**Pros**:
- Written in C - excellent for cryptographic rigor and performance
- Actively maintained with recent updates
- Clean API with good documentation
- Successfully tested and working in our environment
- Can be integrated with Go via CGO
- Suitable for WASM compilation if needed
- Based on well-established libsodium

**Cons**:

- Slightly more complex build process

### 2. Aldenml ECC (C)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/aldenml/ecc
- **Latest Update**: 2023 (outdated)
- **Issue**: Based on outdated VOPRF draft (draft-irtf-cfrg-voprf-21) that was merged into RFC 9497

**Not Recommended**: Outdated and not actively maintained

### 3. Cloudflare opaque-ts (TypeScript)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/cloudflare/opaque-ts
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Maintenance**: Actively maintained by Cloudflare

**Pros**:
- Well-maintained by a reputable company
- Modern TypeScript implementation
- Good for browser-based applications

**Cons**:
- TypeScript is less suitable for backend cryptographic operations
- Would require Node.js runtime for backend
- Mixing TypeScript crypto with Go backend adds complexity
- Less cryptographic rigor compared to C implementations

### 4. Facebook opaque-ke (Rust)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/facebook/opaque-ke
- **Language**: Rust
- **Maintenance**: Maintained by Facebook

**Pros**:
- Memory-safe Rust implementation
- Well-maintained by Facebook
- Good performance

**Cons**:
- Integrating Rust with Go is complex
- Would require additional toolchain
- Adds significant complexity to build process

### 5. Cloudflare Go Libraries (Deprecated)
- **opaque-core**: https://github.com/cloudflare/opaque-core
- **opaque-ea**: https://github.com/cloudflare/opaque-ea
- **Status**: Old and deprecated

**Not Recommended**: No longer maintained

## Security Considerations

### Why C is Appropriate for Crypto

Your instinct to prefer C for cryptographic operations is correct:

1. **Established Track Record**: Most production cryptographic libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium, etc.) are written in C
2. **Predictable Performance**: No garbage collection or runtime overhead
3. **Wide Auditing**: C crypto code has been extensively audited over decades
4. **WASM Compatibility**: C code can be compiled to WASM for client-side use
5. **FFI Support**: Easy to integrate with any language via Foreign Function Interface

### TypeScript Concerns

Your concerns about TypeScript for crypto are valid:

1. **Runtime Environment**: Requires Node.js or browser JavaScript engine
2. **Type Erasure**: TypeScript types don't exist at runtime
3. **Less Crypto Heritage**: JavaScript/TypeScript have less history in cryptographic implementations
4. **Timing Attacks**: JavaScript's event loop and GC can introduce timing vulnerabilities

## Integration Strategy for Arkfile

### Recommended Approach

1. **Use Stef libopaque** for all OPAQUE operations
2. **Server-side**: Integrate via CGO in your Go backend
3. **Client-side**: Compile to WASM for browser use
4. **Keep existing architecture**: No need to change your current Go/WASM approach

### Implementation Steps

1. Continue using the vendor/stef/libopaque directory
2. Create Go bindings using CGO (as you've already started)
3. Compile a WASM version for client-side operations
4. Use the same library on both client and server for consistency

## Test Results

Our testing confirmed that Stef's libopaque:
- ✓ Implements the full OPAQUE protocol correctly
- ✓ Handles registration and login flows properly
- ✓ Correctly rejects invalid passwords
- ✓ Generates consistent export keys
- ✓ Provides proper mutual authentication

## Conclusion

Stef's libopaque is the best choice for Arkfile because it:
1. Is actively maintained (latest release February 2025)
2. Written in C for cryptographic rigor
3. Can be used on both server (via CGO) and client (via WASM)
4. Has been successfully tested and verified
5. Follows the official OPAQUE specification

Your decision to avoid TypeScript for crypto and not mix Rust dependencies is sound. Stick with the C implementation for the best security and maintainability.
