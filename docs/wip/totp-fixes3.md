# TOTP Security Implementation: Comprehensive Review and Current Status

NOTE: There are no current users of this app. There are no deployments currently. Do not worry about migrations.

NOTE: Please do not create any new documentation (e.g. .md docs) during this project.

NOTE: Update this document regularly with our progress. What we have tried. What has worked. What hasn't worked. And remaining issues.

NOTE: Remember when you modify and rebuild arkfile (go), you will likely need to restart all services including rqlite.

This document tracks the implementation of bulletproof Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) enforcement across the Arkfile application. The primary objective is ensuring that no user can access any protected resource without mandatory two-factor authentication, creating a defense-in-depth security architecture that prevents all possible bypass methods.

## Security Foundation Successfully Established

The TOTP implementation has achieved a solid technical foundation with comprehensive RFC 6238 compliance implemented in `auth/totp.go`. The core TOTP functions provide proper cryptographic operations including HMAC-SHA1 algorithm implementation, 30-second time windows, 6-digit code generation, and anti-replay protection through hash-based tracking. The implementation includes 32-byte secret generation with 256-bit entropy, proper Base32 encoding for compatibility with authenticator applications, and backup code generation for account recovery scenarios.

Comprehensive unit test coverage validates all TOTP functionality with 17 individual tests in `auth/totp_test.go` that consistently pass and cover every aspect of the implementation. These tests validate secret generation and storage, TOTP code calculation and verification, backup code handling, replay attack prevention, and edge cases including clock skew tolerance and invalid input handling. The database schema in `database/schema_extensions.sql` properly supports TOTP operations with tables for user TOTP configuration storage, anti-replay logging with 2-minute retention, and backup code usage tracking with 30-day retention.

API endpoints for TOTP operations have been implemented in `handlers/auth.go` including setup initiation, verification completion, authentication validation, status checking, and TOTP disabling functionality. The endpoints properly integrate with the existing OPAQUE authentication flow and maintain session security through encrypted temporary tokens during the setup process.

## Frontend Technology Stack and Build Process Clarification

The Arkfile frontend uses TypeScript as the primary development language, not plain JavaScript. The source files are located in `client/static/js/src/` and include TypeScript files such as `client/static/js/src/auth/totp.ts` for TOTP UI integration. During the build process, these TypeScript files are compiled into JavaScript and output to `client/static/js/dist/app.js` for browser consumption.

Previous references to "JavaScript issues" in this documentation specifically refer to problems with the compiled JavaScript output from the TypeScript build process, not issues with raw JavaScript files. The build system uses modern TypeScript compilation tooling to transform the strongly-typed TypeScript source code into browser-compatible JavaScript. When debugging frontend issues, it is essential to understand that the source files are TypeScript but the runtime files served to browsers are the compiled JavaScript output.

The build process has been updated to ensure reliable TypeScript compilation and proper static file serving. Legacy JavaScript references have been removed from the codebase to avoid confusion between development-time TypeScript sources and runtime JavaScript assets. All frontend development should work with the TypeScript source files, while troubleshooting serving issues should focus on the compiled JavaScript output and static file middleware configuration.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Identified and Resolved

The most significant security vulnerability discovered was the absence of endpoint-level TOTP enforcement. While the login flow properly checked TOTP status and required TOTP verification for authentication, there was no mechanism to prevent users from accessing protected resources if they somehow obtained valid JWT tokens without completing TOTP verification. This represented a critical security gap where theoretical bypass methods could potentially allow unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints.

The solution involved implementing comprehensive RequireTOTP middleware in `handlers/middleware.go`. This middleware function validates that `auth.IsUserTOTPEnabled(database.DB, email)` returns true for every request to protected endpoints, returning HTTP 403 Forbidden with a clear error message if TOTP is not enabled for the requesting user. The middleware properly handles exception logic for TOTP setup endpoints during the registration flow, ensuring users can complete the mandatory TOTP setup process while preventing access to other protected resources.

A severe cryptographic vulnerability was discovered in the registration session key handling within the `OpaqueRegister` function in `handlers/auth.go`. The implementation used a hardcoded session key `sessionKey := []byte("REGISTRATION_TEMP_KEY_32_BYTES!!")` for all TOTP setup encryption during registration. This created serious security risks including cross-user decryption attack vectors, predictable encryption patterns, and fundamental violations of cryptographic key reuse principles.

The fix involved replacing the hardcoded key with cryptographically secure random session key generation using `sessionKey := make([]byte, 32); rand.Read(sessionKey)` with proper error handling for cryptographic failures. Each registration now receives a unique 32-byte random session key, eliminating the cross-user attack vectors and ensuring proper cryptographic isolation between user registration sessions.

Inconsistent TOTP context string usage was identified as a potential source of encryption/decryption failures. The constant `TOTPSetupTempContext = "ARKFILE_TOTP_SETUP_TEMP"` was defined but some code locations used hardcoded strings like `"TOTP_SETUP_TEMP"`. This inconsistency was resolved by standardizing all TOTP context string usage throughout the codebase, particularly in test files where hardcoded contexts were replaced with the defined constants.

## Defense-in-Depth Security Architecture Implementation

The security architecture now implements a comprehensive four-layer defense system. Every user request to protected resources must pass through JWT authentication to validate token authenticity and extract user information, followed by user approval status verification to ensure the account is in good standing, then RequireTOTP middleware validation to confirm TOTP is enabled for the user, and finally access to the protected resource is granted only after passing all previous layers.

Route configuration in `handlers/route_config.go` was restructured to apply this layered security systematically. A protected group was created using `totpProtectedGroup := auth.Echo.Group("")` with `totpProtectedGroup.Use(RequireTOTP)` applied to ensure all sensitive endpoints require TOTP. All file operations including listing, uploading, downloading, deletion, and sharing were moved to the protected group, along with chunked upload operations, file key management, token revocation, and administrative functions.

This architecture ensures that even if vulnerabilities exist in individual security layers, multiple independent checks prevent unauthorized access. The design eliminates single points of failure and creates redundant security validation that would require multiple simultaneous compromises to bypass.

## Critical Integration Issues Blocking Production Use

Despite comprehensive unit test success and sound security architecture, manual end-to-end testing revealed catastrophic integration failures that make the system completely unusable in practice. The TOTP setup endpoint at `/api/totp/setup` consistently fails with the generic error message "Failed to check TOTP status" even when OPAQUE registration completes successfully and temporary tokens are properly generated. This failure occurs immediately upon attempting TOTP setup initiation, preventing users from completing the mandatory TOTP configuration required for account access.

Manual testing using curl commands demonstrates that user registration through the OPAQUE protocol succeeds correctly, creating user accounts and generating appropriate temporary tokens with proper session keys. However, when these valid temporary tokens are used to access the TOTP setup endpoint, the request fails before any TOTP secret generation occurs. The failure appears to happen during the initial TOTP status check within the endpoint handler, suggesting potential issues with JWT token parsing for temporary tokens, database connectivity during TOTP status verification, or session key handling between registration and TOTP setup phases.

The frontend web interface is completely non-functional due to static file serving configuration problems. Browser developer tools reveal that JavaScript files are being served with incorrect MIME types, specifically `application/json` instead of `text/javascript`, causing browsers to refuse script execution with error messages like "Refused to execute script because its MIME type is not executable." Additional errors indicate missing JavaScript functions and failed resource loading, suggesting that the TypeScript compilation process may not be completing successfully or the generated files are not being served from the correct paths.

Investigation of the static file serving configuration in the Go server reveals potential routing issues where JavaScript assets may not be properly mapped to their file system locations. The TypeScript build process in `client/static/js/` appears to complete without errors during the build phase, but the resulting `dist/app.js` file may not be accessible through the web server's static file middleware configuration.

## Integration Testing Methodology Gap

The fundamental issue revealed through this process is that comprehensive unit tests, while valuable for validating individual function correctness, are insufficient for ensuring production readiness of complex integrated systems. The unit tests validate TOTP cryptographic operations, database storage and retrieval, and individual function behaviors in isolation, but they do not test the complete HTTP request/response flows, frontend JavaScript integration, static file serving, or end-to-end user authentication journeys.

Manual testing using real HTTP requests, actual browser interactions, and complete user workflows exposed critical integration failures that automated unit tests completely missed. This gap in testing methodology means that while the core TOTP implementation functions correctly in isolation, the system integration points fail catastrophically when used in realistic scenarios.

The testing methodology needs to be enhanced with comprehensive end-to-end integration tests that validate complete API request/response cycles, frontend JavaScript functionality in browser environments, static asset serving and MIME type configuration, and full user authentication flows from registration through TOTP setup to successful login and resource access.

## Immediate Emergency Repairs Required

The TOTP setup endpoint failure requires immediate investigation with extensive logging added to the `/api/totp/setup` handler in `handlers/auth.go`. The request flow needs to be traced from HTTP request receipt through JWT token parsing, user identification, database TOTP status checking, and session key retrieval. Specific attention should be paid to how temporary tokens from registration are being processed differently from full access tokens and whether the database queries for TOTP status are executing successfully against the correct user records.

Debugging should include verification that the JWT token parsing correctly extracts user information from temporary tokens generated during registration, confirmation that database connectivity functions properly during TOTP status checks with detailed logging of query execution and results, validation that session keys generated during registration are properly stored and retrievable during TOTP setup, and investigation of any differences in token validation logic between registration endpoints and TOTP setup endpoints.

The frontend JavaScript serving issues require investigation of static file routing configuration within the Go server. The MIME type configuration needs to be verified to ensure `.js` files are served as `text/javascript` rather than `application/json`. The TypeScript build process should be validated to confirm that compilation completes successfully and generates the expected `client/static/js/dist/app.js` output file. Direct access testing of JavaScript files through their expected URLs should verify that the static file middleware properly serves these assets.

Route configuration in `handlers/route_config.go` should be examined to ensure static file routes are properly configured to serve JavaScript assets from the correct directory structure. The build process integration should be validated to confirm that TypeScript compilation occurs during the deployment phase and that generated assets are available when the server starts.

## Development and Testing Script Issues

Several testing scripts contain syntax errors that prevent comprehensive validation of fixes. The script `scripts/test-opaque-totp-flow-curl.sh` has bash syntax errors around line 539 that cause execution failures. These syntax issues prevent validation of the complete OPAQUE to TOTP authentication flow that is critical for verifying that integration fixes work correctly.

The testing infrastructure needs to be repaired to enable comprehensive validation of fixes as they are implemented. Working test scripts are essential for confirming that TOTP setup endpoints function correctly, that complete authentication flows work end-to-end, and that frontend integration operates properly after JavaScript serving issues are resolved.

## Essential Testing and Setup Scripts

The following scripts are critical for development and testing during this TOTP implementation project:

**System Management Scripts:**
- `scripts/setup/uninstall.sh` - Completely removes Arkfile installation including services, databases, and configuration files. Essential for clean slate testing and resolving persistent configuration issues. Use this when database setup problems require starting completely fresh.

- `scripts/quick-start.sh` - Automated setup script that installs dependencies, builds the application, configures services, and starts everything in demo mode. This is the primary script for initial system setup and should be run after using the uninstall script for clean installations.

**TOTP Testing Scripts (prioritized by usefulness):**
- `scripts/wip/test-build-and-totp-complete.v2.sh` - **HIGHEST PRIORITY** - This is the most comprehensive and recently developed testing script that combines TypeScript build verification, service health checks, user registration, TOTP setup, and end-to-end authentication flow testing. This script represents the current state of integration testing and should be the primary tool for validating fixes. It includes proper error handling and detailed output for debugging integration issues.

- `scripts/wip/test-build-and-totp-complete.sh` - Previous version of the comprehensive testing script. Less refined than v2 but may contain useful debugging approaches. Use only if v2 script fails or for reference purposes.

- `scripts/test-totp-endpoints-curl.sh` - Focused testing script that validates individual TOTP API endpoints using curl. Useful for testing specific endpoint functionality in isolation, particularly when debugging the TOTP setup endpoint failure. Good for targeted testing after making specific API fixes.

- `scripts/test-opaque-totp-flow-curl.sh` - Tests the complete OPAQUE authentication followed by TOTP verification flow. **CURRENTLY BROKEN** due to bash syntax errors around line 539. Should be fixed before use, but represents valuable end-to-end authentication testing once repaired.

**Script Selection Priority for Future Development:**
1. Use `scripts/wip/test-build-and-totp-complete.v2.sh` as the primary testing tool for validating integration fixes and overall system functionality
2. Use `scripts/test-totp-endpoints-curl.sh` for targeted debugging of specific TOTP endpoint issues
3. Fix and then use `scripts/test-opaque-totp-flow-curl.sh` for comprehensive authentication flow validation
4. Use `scripts/setup/uninstall.sh` followed by `scripts/quick-start.sh` when clean slate testing is required

The v2 comprehensive testing script should be considered the gold standard for validating that integration issues have been resolved, as it tests the complete user journey from system build through TOTP authentication that represents real-world usage patterns.

**Future Script Consolidation Goal:**
At the completion of this TOTP implementation project, all OPAQUE and TOTP authentication-related curl-based testing functionality should be consolidated into a single comprehensive script located at `scripts/test-complete-auth-flow.sh`. This consolidated script should perform the complete end-to-end authentication test sequence: check API health status, use a fixed email address for consistent testing, attempt OPAQUE user registration, complete mandatory TOTP setup for two-factor authentication, perform login with both password and TOTP verification, list files from the authenticated session (which should return empty results for new users), and finally perform proper logout. This single script will serve as the definitive functional authentication test that validates the entire security architecture from registration through authenticated resource access, replacing the current collection of individual testing scripts with one comprehensive validation tool.

## Path Forward and Success Criteria

The immediate path forward involves systematic debugging of the TOTP setup endpoint failure to identify why real-world API calls fail while unit tests pass. This requires extensive logging additions to trace request processing, token validation, database operations, and session key handling. The debugging process should identify the specific point of failure and the root cause of the status check error.

Frontend static file serving must be fixed to restore web interface functionality. This involves correcting MIME type configuration, verifying TypeScript build processes, and ensuring proper static asset routing configuration. The web interface must be fully functional for users to complete TOTP setup and authentication flows.

Integration testing methodology must be enhanced to catch these types of real-world failures before they block production deployment. This includes creating automated tests that validate complete HTTP request/response cycles, browser-based frontend testing, and end-to-end user workflow validation.

The system will be considered production-ready when users can successfully register accounts through either web interface or API, complete mandatory TOTP setup with working secret generation and QR codes, verify TOTP setup by successfully validating generated codes, login using OPAQUE authentication followed by TOTP code verification, access protected resources only after completing both authentication factors, and use backup codes for account recovery when primary TOTP methods are unavailable.

Long-term security enhancements should include implementation of TOTP rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on verification codes, comprehensive security event logging for audit trails and suspicious activity detection, enforcement that administrative users cannot bypass TOTP requirements, and thorough security audits to validate that no bypass methods exist in the complete implementation.

## Current Blocking Issues Summary

The TOTP setup endpoint at `/api/totp/setup` fails completely with "Failed to check TOTP status" errors, preventing completion of mandatory TOTP configuration. Frontend JavaScript is non-functional due to static file serving configuration issues that serve scripts with incorrect MIME types. Test scripts contain syntax errors that prevent comprehensive validation of authentication flows. Despite perfect unit test results, the system is unusable for real-world user interactions.

The core TOTP implementation functions correctly in isolation, the security architecture properly implements defense-in-depth principles, the database schema supports all required TOTP operations, and the RequireTOTP middleware provides comprehensive endpoint protection. However, integration failures prevent the system from functioning as a cohesive whole, demonstrating the critical importance of end-to-end testing in addition to unit test validation.

Resolution of these integration issues will transform the system from a collection of working components into a fully functional, secure, and production-ready authentication system that enforces mandatory TOTP for all users without possible bypass methods.
