# TOTP Implementation Review and Fixes

NOTE: There are no current users of this app. There are no deployments currently. Do not worry about migrations.

NOTE: Please do not create any new documentation (e.g. .md docs) during this project.

NOTE: Update this document regularly with our progress. What we have tried. What has worked. What hasn't worked. And remaining issues.

NOTE: Remember when you modify and rebuild arkfile (go), you will likely need to restart all services including rqlite.

## Overview

This document tracks the comprehensive review and validation of TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) implementation across the entire Arkfile application, including backend Go code, WASM client, and TypeScript frontend. The goal is to ensure bulletproof TOTP enforcement with no possible bypasses.

## Current Implementation Assessment

### Strong Foundation Completed
The TOTP implementation has a solid foundation with the following components working correctly:

#### Backend Implementation (Go)
- **auth/totp.go**: Core TOTP functions with comprehensive RFC 6238 compliance
- **auth/totp_test.go**: 17 unit tests covering all TOTP functionality (ALL PASSING)
- **handlers/auth.go**: HTTP API endpoints for TOTP operations
- **crypto/session.go**: Session key derivation with domain separation
- **database/schema_extensions.sql**: TOTP storage and anti-replay logging

#### Frontend Integration
- **client/main.go**: WASM client using shared backend TOTP functions
- **client/static/js/src/auth/totp.ts**: TypeScript UI integration with modal flows
- **client/static/totp-test.html**: Testing interface

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **scripts/test-totp-endpoints-curl.sh**: API endpoint validation
- **scripts/test-opaque-totp-flow-curl.sh**: Full authentication flow tests
- **scripts/totp-generator.go**: Command-line TOTP code generation tool

### Previously Fixed Critical Issues
1. **Base32 Padding Bug**: TOTP secrets stored without padding but validation expected padding - RESOLVED
2. **Session Key Context Mismatch**: Setup and verification used different context strings - RESOLVED
3. **Unit Test Coverage**: All 17 TOTP unit tests now pass consistently

## Critical Security Gaps Identified

### 1. Missing RequireTOTP Middleware (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: The current implementation lacks a comprehensive middleware that blocks non-TOTP users from accessing protected resources. While login checks TOTP status, there's no continuous verification at the endpoint level.

**Current Risk**: A user could theoretically obtain a full access token through any potential bypass in the login flow and access protected resources without TOTP.

**Location**: `handlers/middleware.go` has `RequireApproved` but no `RequireTOTP`

**Solution Required**: 
- Create `RequireTOTP` middleware that checks `IsUserTOTPEnabled()` for all protected routes
- Apply this middleware to all sensitive endpoints in addition to JWT middleware
- Ensure defense-in-depth approach where TOTP is verified at multiple layers

### 2. Registration Session Key Vulnerability (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: In `handlers/auth.go`, the `OpaqueRegister` function uses a hardcoded session key:
```go
sessionKey := []byte("REGISTRATION_TEMP_KEY_32_BYTES!!") // Exactly 32 bytes
```

**Security Risk**: All registration TOTP setups use the same encryption key, making them vulnerable to:
- Cross-user decryption attacks
- Predictable encryption patterns
- Cryptographic key reuse violations

**Solution Required**: Generate cryptographically secure random session keys for each registration

### 3. Inconsistent TOTP Context Constants

**Problem**: TOTP context strings are defined inconsistently:
- Constant: `TOTPSetupTempContext = "ARKFILE_TOTP_SETUP_TEMP"`
- Hardcoded: `"TOTP_SETUP_TEMP"` in some locations

**Risk**: Potential decryption failures if contexts don't match exactly

**Solution Required**: Use the defined constant consistently throughout the codebase

### 4. Incomplete Route Protection Audit

**Problem**: Need to verify that ALL sensitive routes properly enforce TOTP requirement through middleware layering.

**Current Status**: Routes use `auth.Echo` (JWT middleware) but lack explicit TOTP verification middleware

## Comprehensive Security Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Security Fixes (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1.1 Implement RequireTOTP Middleware
- Create new middleware function in `handlers/middleware.go`
- Check `auth.IsUserTOTPEnabled()` for each request

#### 3.4 Token Validation Enhancement
- Strengthen temporary vs full token validation
- Ensure token scope restrictions are properly enforced
- Implement token type verification at all endpoints
- Session token security audit and hardening

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Validation and Testing (LOW PRIORITY)

#### 4.1 Existing Test Suite Validation
- Ensure all 17 unit tests continue to pass
- Run complete auth package test suite (39 tests)
- Validate no regressions in existing functionality
- Performance testing for TOTP operations

#### 4.2 API Endpoint Testing with curl Scripts

- Documentation of security assurance measures

## Technical Implementation Details

### TOTP Configuration (VERIFIED CORRECT)
- **Algorithm**: HMAC-SHA1 (RFC 6238 standard)
- **Period**: 30 seconds
- **Digits**: 6
- **Skew Tolerance**: Â±1 window (90 seconds total)
- **Secret Length**: 32 bytes (256-bit entropy)

### Security Features (IMPLEMENTED)
- **Anti-Replay Protection**: Hash-based tracking prevents code reuse
- **Backup Codes**: 10 single-use recovery codes per user
- **Session Encryption**: AES-GCM with derived keys for data protection
- **Secure Memory**: Proper cleanup of sensitive key material

### Database Schema (WORKING)
- **user_totp**: Main TOTP configuration storage
- **totp_usage_log**: Anti-replay tracking (2-minute retention)
- **totp_backup_usage**: Backup code usage tracking (30-day retention)

## Mandatory TOTP Enforcement Strategy

### Registration Flow (REQUIRES HARDENING)
1. User completes OPAQUE registration
2. System generates SECURE random session key (FIX REQUIRED)
3. TOTP setup must be completed before full account access
4. RequireTOTP middleware blocks access until setup complete (NEW REQUIREMENT)

### Login Flow (REQUIRES MIDDLEWARE ENHANCEMENT)
1. User completes OPAQUE authentication
2. System checks TOTP requirement (existing check)
3. Temporary token issued requiring TOTP verification
4. RequireTOTP middleware continuously enforces requirement (NEW REQUIREMENT)
5. Full access token only provided after TOTP validation

### API Endpoints (FUNCTIONAL)
- `POST /api/totp/setup` - Initialize TOTP configuration
- `POST /api/totp/verify` - Complete setup with test code
- `POST /api/totp/auth` - Authenticate with TOTP code
- `GET /api/totp/status` - Check TOTP status
- `POST /api/totp/disable` - Disable TOTP (requires current code)

**Problem Encountered**: 
```
libopaque.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
FAIL	github.com/84adam/arkfile/auth	0.001s
```
**Root Cause**: Missing libopaque shared library required for OPAQUE authentication integration
**Resolution Applied**: â **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
- Use proper test infrastructure: `./scripts/testing/test-totp.sh` instead of raw `go test`
- Test script automatically configures library paths: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` properly set

## CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED DURING MANUAL TESTING (2025-01-24)

### Manual Testing Session Results â MULTIPLE CRITICAL FAILURES

**Testing Date**: January 24, 2025
**Testing Method**: Manual browser testing + curl API validation
**Overall Status**: â **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED** - System NOT production ready

Despite all unit tests passing, manual end-to-end testing revealed several critical issues that prevent the TOTP system from working in real-world scenarios:

### 1. TOTP Code Validation Complete Failure â CRITICAL

**Problem**: All generated TOTP codes are being rejected as "Invalid TOTP code"
**Test Evidence**:
- Generated valid codes: 674160, 171782, 364151
- All codes rejected by `/api/totp/verify` endpoint
- TOTP generator tool working correctly (confirmed via unit tests)
- Issue appears to be in validation logic, not generation

**Root Cause Analysis Needed**:
- Time synchronization between generator and validator
- Secret storage/retrieval consistency issues
- Session key derivation problems during TOTP setup
- Context string mismatches between setup and verification

**Impact**: â **SYSTEM BREAKING** - Users cannot complete TOTP setup or authentication

**Status**: ð´ **UNRESOLVED** - Highest priority fix required

### 2. Frontend JavaScript Complete Failure â CRITICAL

**Problem**: Web interface completely non-functional due to JavaScript loading issues
**Browser Errors Observed**:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
Refused to execute script from 'https://localhost:4443/js/security.js' 
because its MIME type ('application/json') is not executable
ReferenceError: toggleAuthForm is not defined
ReferenceError: login is not defined
```

**Impact**: â **SYSTEM BREAKING** - Web interface unusable for end users
- Registration form non-functional (toggleAuthForm missing)
- Login form non-functional (login function missing)  
- No way for users to interact with TOTP system via web interface

**Root Cause Analysis Needed**:
- JavaScript files served with wrong MIME type (application/json instead of text/javascript)
- Static file routing configuration issues
- TypeScript compilation/build process problems
- Asset serving configuration in Go server

**Status**: ð´ **UNRESOLVED** - Critical for user experience

### 3. Backup Code Format Mismatch â HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem**: Backup codes have wrong format for validation endpoints
**Test Evidence**:
- System generates 10-character backup codes: "Q6AHKAFUPN"
- `/api/totp/verify` endpoint rejects with "TOTP code must be 6 digits"
- Backup codes should work with `/api/totp/auth` not `/api/totp/verify`

**Root Cause**: API endpoint confusion and validation logic mismatch
- `/api/totp/verify` is for TOTP setup completion (6-digit codes only)
- `/api/totp/auth` is for login authentication (supports backup codes)
- Frontend/documentation doesn't clearly distinguish these endpoints

**Impact**: â **RECOVERY IMPOSSIBLE** - Users cannot use backup codes for account recovery

**Status**: ð¡ **PARTIALLY UNDERSTOOD** - Need to test correct endpoint usage

### 4. OPAQUE + TOTP Integration Issues â HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem**: TOTP authentication flow breaks after successful OPAQUE login
**Test Evidence**:
- OPAQUE login succeeds: "OPAQUE authentication successful. TOTP code required."
- Correct temporary token and session key provided
- TOTP code validation fails with generated codes
- Users stuck in authentication limbo

**Impact**: â **LOGIN IMPOSSIBLE** - Users cannot complete full authentication flow

**Status**: ð´ **BLOCKING** - Core authentication flow broken

4. **Complete Security Audit**: Third-party validation

## Files Requiring Modification

### Core Security Implementation
- `handlers/middleware.go` - Add RequireTOTP middleware
- `handlers/auth.go` - Fix registration session key generation
- `handlers/route_config.go` - Apply RequireTOTP middleware to routes
- `auth/totp.go` - Ensure consistent context constant usage

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure  
- `auth/totp_test.go` - Add bypass prevention tests
- `handlers/auth_test.go` - Add integration security tests
- `scripts/test-totp-complete-flow-manual.sh` - Enhanced end-to-end testing
- New security test files for comprehensive validation

### Documentation Updates
- `docs/wip/totp-fixes.md` - This comprehensive planning document

## Success Criteria

The TOTP implementation will be considered bulletproof when:

1. **No Bypass Possible**: No method exists to access protected resources without TOTP
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers prevent circumvention
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: All attack vectors have been tested and blocked
4. **Clean Security Audit**: Third-party validation confirms implementation security
5. **User Experience**: Mandatory TOTP is seamless and properly enforced
6. **Admin Compliance**: Even administrative users must comply with TOTP requirements

## Conclusion

The TOTP implementation has a strong foundation with critical security bugs already resolved. The remaining work focuses on implementing comprehensive security hardening through middleware layering, fixing the registration session key vulnerability, and creating exhaustive security validation testing.

The approach emphasizes defense-in-depth security principles where TOTP requirement is enforced at multiple layers rather than relying on single-point validation. This ensures that even if one security check were to fail, additional layers would prevent unauthorized access.

Once all Phase 1 security fixes are implemented, the TOTP system will provide robust mandatory two-factor authentication for all Arkfile users with no possible bypass methods.
