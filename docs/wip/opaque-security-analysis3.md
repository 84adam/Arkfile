# Arkfile OPAQUE Security Architecture Implementation

## Introduction

### Application Overview

Arkfile is an open-source zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing and backup service that provides:

- **Client-side encryption**: Files are encrypted before upload, ensuring server never sees readable content
- **S3-compatible storage**: Works with MinIO, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, and other S3-compatible backends
- **OPAQUE authentication**: Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol for secure authentication
- **TOTP multi-factor**: Time-based One-Time Password support for enhanced security
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: Server cannot access user passwords or file content

### Project Goals

This project implements a comprehensive OPAQUE security architecture cleanup to achieve:

1. **Pure OPAQUE-only authentication**: Eliminate all legacy Argon2ID contamination
2. **Unified cryptographic architecture**: Single authentication path through OPAQUE protocol
3. **Comprehensive test coverage**: Modern mock-based testing without external dependencies
4. **Clean codebase**: Remove all dual authentication systems and legacy patterns

**Greenfield Status**: Confirmed - No existing users, deployments, or backwards compatibility requirements

This greenfield status enables aggressive architectural changes that would be impossible in production environments with existing users.

### Target Architecture

The final OPAQUE-unified architecture follows this flow:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌────────────────────┐
│ User Password   │ -> │ OPAQUE           │ -> │ Export Key         │
│ (Any Type)      │    │ Authentication   │    │ (64 bytes)         │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └────────────────────┘
                                                          │
                                                          ▼
                                               ┌────────────────────┐
                                               │ HKDF Derivation    │
                                               │ (Domain Separated) │
                                               └────────────────────┘
                                                          │
                        ┌─────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────┐
                        ▼                                 ▼                                 ▼
              ┌─────────────────┐               ┌─────────────────┐               ┌─────────────────┐
              │ Account File    │               │ Custom File     │               │ Share Access    │
              │ Encryption Keys │               │ Encryption Keys │               │ Keys            │
              └─────────────────┘               └─────────────────┘               └─────────────────┘
```

**Core Principles**:
- **Single Authentication Path**: All passwords flow through OPAQUE
- **Export Key Foundation**: All cryptographic operations derive from OPAQUE export keys
- **Zero Argon2ID**: No Argon2ID references anywhere in the system
- **Domain Separation**: Different HKDF info strings prevent key reuse across contexts

## Previous Work

**Greenfield Status**: Confirmed - No existing users, deployments, or backwards compatibility requirements

The aggressive cleanup approach was possible due to the greenfield nature of this project, allowing complete removal of legacy systems without migration concerns.

### Phase 1: Database Schema Purge ✅ COMPLETED

**Current Status**: Tests are structurally clean (no legacy schema references) but functionally incomplete.

**Outstanding Issues**:
- Tests skip OPAQUE validation with comments like "requires mocking complex cryptographic operations"
- Mock helpers set up database expectations but handlers still call real OPAQUE functions
- No functional validation of OPAQUE authentication workflows

**Greenfield Status**: Confirmed - No existing users, deployments, or backwards compatibility requirements

**Impact**: Eliminated legacy test contamination but revealed need for comprehensive mock-based testing approach.

## Remaining Work

**Greenfield Status**: Confirmed - No existing users, deployments, or backwards compatibility requirements

### Phase 4B: Mock-Based OPAQUE Testing ✅ COMPLETED

- **Error Simulation**: Configurable failures for comprehensive error path testing
- **State Tracking**: Complete call tracking and verification capabilities
- **Password Validation**: Proper password strength validation without cryptography
- **Build Tag Support**: Clean separation via `//go:build mock` tags

#### 3. Test Environment Configuration ✅ COMPLETED
**Seamless mock/real provider switching with environment control**

**Configuration Implementation**:
- **Environment Variable**: `OPAQUE_MOCK_MODE=true` enables mock provider
- **Build Tags**: `//go:build mock` for mock-specific test files
- **Factory Pattern**: Automatic provider selection based on environment
- **Test Helper Integration**: Mock providers integrated into existing test helpers

#### 4. Build System Compatibility ✅ COMPLETED
**Resolved all build tag conflicts and CLI tool compatibility issues**

**Build Issues Resolved**:
- **Missing Function Error**: `auth.GetOPAQUEServer` undefined in mock builds
- **Build Tag Conflicts**: Functions with `//go:build !mock` not available during mock testing
- **CLI Tool Integration**: `cmd/cryptocli` now builds successfully in both modes

**Technical Solution**:
- Created `auth/opaque_mock_server.go` with mock version of `GetOPAQUEServer()`
- Applied proper build constraints: `//go:build mock` for mock implementations
- Fixed function signature handling in `cmd/cryptocli/commands/commands.go`

**Build Verification Results**:
```bash
$ go build ./cmd/cryptocli
Standard build: SUCCESS

$ OPAQUE_MOCK_MODE=true go build -tags=mock ./cmd/cryptocli  
Mock build: SUCCESS
```

#### 5. Handler Test Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
**Comprehensive HTTP workflow validation using mocked OPAQUE**

**Test Coverage Implemented**:

- ✅ `TestUploadFile_UpdateStorageError` - Storage update failures (PASSING)
- ✅ `TestUploadFile_CommitError` - Transaction commit failures (PASSING)

**Upload Test Issues Resolution**:
**RESOLVED**: Fixed SQL pattern matching issues in mock expectations using `sqlmock.AnyArg()` for dynamic values like storage IDs and padded sizes. The key issue was that the tests were using `mock.AnythingOfType()` patterns that didn't match the actual SQL driver argument types used by the handler.

**Technical Solution Applied**:
- Updated SQL mock expectations to use `sqlmock.AnyArg()` for generated values (storage IDs, padded sizes)
- Maintained precise matching for user-controlled values (filenames, emails, file sizes)
- Fixed database transaction rollback expectations to match actual handler error flow
- Verified storage cleanup expectations match handler behavior (only on metadata insertion failure)

**Upload Handler Test Suite Status: ALL TESTS PASSING ✅**

#### 9. Administrative Handler Test Updates ✅ COMPLETED
**All administrative operations tested with mock framework**

**Admin Test Coverage**:
- ✅ User management operations (approve, delete, update storage limits)
- ✅ Admin privilege validation and access control
- ✅ Bulk operations and error handling
- ✅ Audit logging and security event tracking

**Admin Test Suite Status: ALL TESTS PASSING ✅**

#### 10. Comprehensive Test Suite Results ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 5: Client-Side File Encryption Migration

**Objective**: Replace client-side Argon2ID with OPAQUE export key approach to achieve complete OPAQUE architectural unification

#### Current State Analysis

**✅ COMPLETED**: Phases 1-4B have successfully eliminated Argon2ID from the server-side authentication system and implemented comprehensive mock-based testing.

**✅ COMPLETED - Phase 5A**: Server-Side OPAQUE Export Key Integration successfully implemented.

**🎯 REMAINING**: Phases 5B-5D need to complete the client-side migration and system cleanup.

#### Phase 5A: Server-Side OPAQUE Export Key Integration - ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Results**:

**1. User Model Export Key Management** ✅
- **File**: `models/user.go`
- Added `GetOPAQUEExportKey()` method for secure export key retrieval
- Added `ValidateOPAQUEExportKey()` method for proper validation (64-byte requirement)
- Added `SecureZeroExportKey()` method for secure memory cleanup
- Enhanced existing `AuthenticateOPAQUE()` method to return export keys

**2. Authentication Handler Updates** ✅
- **File**: `handlers/auth.go`
- Modified `OpaqueRegister()` to derive session keys from OPAQUE export keys using HKDF
- Modified `OpaqueLogin()` to derive session keys from OPAQUE export keys using HKDF
- Implemented proper export key validation and secure memory clearing
- Integrated with existing `crypto.DeriveSessionKey()` function for domain separation

**3. Security Enhancements** ✅
- **Export Key Validation**: All export keys validated as 64-byte, non-zero values
- **Secure Memory Management**: Export keys immediately cleared from memory after use
- **HKDF Integration**: Proper domain separation using `crypto.SessionKeyContext`
- **Session Key Security**: Session keys properly encoded for transmission and cleared after encoding

**4. Test Validation** ✅
- All existing tests continue to pass with the new export key integration
- Mock OPAQUE provider properly handles export key generation and validation
- Authentication workflows validated with proper export key → session key derivation

**Key Architecture Achievement**:
```
✅ IMPLEMENTED: User Password → OPAQUE Authentication → Export Key → HKDF → Session Key
❌ STILL TO DO: Session Key → Client File Encryption (Phases 5B-5D)
```

**Phase 5A Success Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Server provides OPAQUE export keys securely to clients
- ✅ Export keys properly validated (64 bytes, non-zero)
- ✅ Session keys derived using HKDF with proper domain separation
- ✅ Export keys securely cleared from memory immediately after use
- ✅ All tests passing with new export key integration
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing authentication flows

#### Problem Statement

The client-side code in `client/main.go` still uses Argon2ID for file encryption key derivation, creating a dual authentication system:

- **Server**: Pure OPAQUE authentication ✅
- **Client**: Still using Argon2ID for file encryption ❌

This inconsistency violates the target architecture of "OPAQUE export key → HKDF derivation for all cryptographic operations."

#### Target Architecture

```
Current Client Flow:
User Password → Argon2ID (client-side) → File Encryption Key

Target OPAQUE Flow:
User Password → OPAQUE Authentication (server) → Export Key → Session Key (client) → File Encryption Key
```

#### Implementation Strategy

##### Phase 5A: Server-Side OPAQUE Export Key Integration

**1. Update Authentication Handlers**
- **File**: `handlers/auth.go`
- Modify OPAQUE login endpoint to return export key alongside JWT token
- Add secure session key derivation from OPAQUE export key
- Implement proper export key transmission to client (encrypted/secure channel)

**2. Add Export Key Management to User Model**
- **File**: `models/user.go`
- Add methods to retrieve OPAQUE export keys after authentication
- Implement secure export key handling and validation
- Add session key derivation utilities

##### Phase 5B: Client-Side Migration

**3. Replace Argon2ID Functions in client/main.go**
- **File**: `client/main.go`

**Functions to REMOVE**:
- `deriveKeyArgon2ID()` - Delete entirely
- `deriveKeyWithDeviceCapability()` - Delete entirely
- `deriveSessionKey()` - Replace with OPAQUE export key approach
- All Argon2ID profile functions (`ArgonInteractive`, `ArgonBalanced`, etc.)

**Functions to ADD/MODIFY**:
- `receiveOPAQUEExportKey()` - Receive export key from server after authentication
- `deriveSessionKeyFromExport()` - Use `crypto.DeriveSessionKey()` instead of Argon2ID
- Update all file encryption functions to use HKDF-derived keys

**4. Update File Encryption Functions**
- **File**: `client/main.go`

**encryptFile() modifications**:
- Remove client-side Argon2ID key derivation
- Use session key derived from OPAQUE export key
- Update encryption format to reflect OPAQUE-based approach

**decryptFile() modifications**:
- Remove Argon2ID decryption paths
- Use session key for all account-based file decryption
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing custom password files

##### Phase 5C: Crypto System Cleanup

**5. Delete crypto/kdf.go Entirely**
- **File**: `crypto/kdf.go` - **DELETE FILE**

This file contains all Argon2ID key derivation functions that are no longer needed:
- `DeriveKeyArgon2ID()`
- `DeriveKeyFromCapability()`
- `ArgonProfile` structs
- Device capability detection

**6. Update crypto/envelope.go**
- **File**: `crypto/envelope.go`

**Remove Argon2ID References**:
- Remove all `DeriveKeyArgon2ID()` calls
- Replace with `crypto.DeriveSessionKey()` and HKDF approaches
- Update key derivation to use OPAQUE export keys

**7. Update WASM Functions**
- **File**: `crypto/wasm_shim.go`

**Functions to REMOVE**:
- All Argon2ID benchmarking functions
- `adaptiveArgon2IDJS()` 
- `DetectDeviceCapabilityWASM()`
- Argon2ID performance profiling

**Functions to ENHANCE**:
- `createSecureSessionFromOpaqueExportJS()` - Already partially implemented
- `encryptFileWithSecureSession()` - Use proper HKDF derivation
- Connect WASM session management to updated client encryption

##### Phase 5D: Legacy Format Handling

**8. Version Migration Strategy**
- **Files**: `client/main.go`, `crypto/envelope.go`

**Approach**:
- **NEW FILES**: Use OPAQUE-derived session keys (version 0x06)
- **EXISTING FILES**: Maintain decryption support for older formats (0x04, 0x05)
- **CUSTOM PASSWORDS**: Continue supporting Argon2ID for custom password files (not account-based)

**Implementation**:
- Add new encryption version 0x06 = "OPAQUE session key derived"
- Keep legacy decryption support for backward compatibility
- Clear migration path for users to re-encrypt files with new format

#### Implementation Order

**Priority 1: Server-Side Foundation**
1. Update `handlers/auth.go` to provide OPAQUE export keys
2. Enhance `models/user.go` with export key management
3. Test server-side export key flow

**Priority 2: Client-Side Core Migration**
4. Update `client/main.go` session key derivation (remove Argon2ID)
5. Modify file encryption to use OPAQUE-derived session keys
6. Test new encryption/decryption flow

**Priority 3: System Cleanup**
7. Delete `crypto/kdf.go` entirely
8. Update `crypto/envelope.go` to use HKDF approach
9. Clean up `crypto/wasm_shim.go` Argon2ID functions

**Priority 4: Legacy Support & Testing**
10. Implement backward compatibility for existing encrypted files
11. Add comprehensive test coverage for migration scenarios
12. Validate end-to-end OPAQUE flow

#### Success Criteria

**Quantitative Goals**:
- **Zero Argon2ID references** in client-side account password flows
- **All account-based file encryption** uses OPAQUE export key → HKDF derivation
- **100% test coverage** for new OPAQUE-based encryption
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for existing files

**Qualitative Achievements**:
- **Unified Authentication**: Single OPAQUE path for all account-based cryptography
- **Domain Separation**: Proper HKDF contexts prevent key reuse
- **Security Improvement**: Client never stores raw passwords or derives keys from passwords
- **Architecture Consistency**: Client and server both use OPAQUE export key foundation

#### Risk Mitigation

**Data Loss Prevention**:
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All existing file decryption paths thoroughly tested
- **Gradual Migration**: Users can re-encrypt files progressively
- **Legacy Support**: Maintain old format decryption indefinitely

**Implementation Validation**:
- **Mock Testing**: Use existing Phase 4B mock framework for development
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end OPAQUE flow validation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Verify all existing encrypted files remain accessible

#### Architecture Benefits

After Phase 5 completion:
- **Single Source of Truth**: OPAQUE export key is foundation for all account cryptography
- **Proper Domain Separation**: Different HKDF contexts for sessions, files, JWT, TOTP
- **Enhanced Security**: Client-side key derivation eliminated (server-side OPAQUE only)
- **Clean Codebase**: No dual authentication systems or legacy Argon2ID contamination

**Greenfield Status**: Confirmed - No existing users, deployments, or backwards compatibility requirements

This represents the final step in achieving complete OPAQUE architectural unification across the entire system.

# TODO: INTEGRATE NEW PLAN BELOW INTO ABOVE DOCUMENT IN A COHERENT WAY

## Updated Complete End-to-End Share System Flow Overview

**Initial File Upload**: When the owner uploads "joeyphotos.zip", their client first derives a session key from their OPAQUE authentication (export key → HKDF → session key), generates a random File Encryption Key (FEK), encrypts the file using AES-GCM with the FEK, then encrypts the FEK using their session key. The client uploads the encrypted file blob to the server, which stores it immutably in S3/Backblaze under a GUID name, while the database contains only metadata (filename, size, storage ID, encrypted FEK) - the server never sees the plaintext file, session key, or raw FEK.

**Adding Share Access**: Later, when the owner wants to create a share link, they provide an 18+ character share password (e.g., "MyVacation2025PhotosForFamily!"). The client generates a random salt, applies Argon2id with 128MB memory/4 iterations/4 threads to derive `share_key = Argon2id(share_password, salt)`, downloads and decrypts the stored FEK using the owner's session key, then encrypts the FEK with the derived share key: `encrypted_FEK_share = AES-GCM(FEK, share_key)`. The client sends only the salt and encrypted_FEK_share to the server, which stores these in a `file_share_keys` database table. The server generates a share link containing the file ID but never sees the share password, derived share key, or raw FEK.

**Anonymous Access**: When a visitor receives the share link and password out-of-band, they enter the share password in their browser, which downloads the salt and encrypted_FEK_share from the server, applies the same Argon2id derivation client-side to recover the share key, decrypts the FEK, downloads the encrypted file blob from S3, and decrypts it entirely in the browser. The visitor never needs an account, and their password never leaves their browser in plaintext form.

**Security Analysis**: This system maintains perfect zero-knowledge properties - even with complete server compromise, attackers gain access only to random salts and encrypted FEKs, requiring offline Argon2id attacks against 18+ character passwords to recover anything useful. Account-only files remain completely inaccessible since they depend on OPAQUE sessions that can't be derived from database contents. The trade-off is that shared files become vulnerable to dictionary attacks if users choose weak share passwords, but the Argon2id parameters (128MB memory requirement) make such attacks extremely expensive and slow. The key benefit is practical anonymous file sharing without compromising the core zero-knowledge architecture - shared files accept controlled risk in exchange for usability, while non-shared files maintain perfect security even under total server compromise.

## Updated Complete End-to-End Share System Flow Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes

**New Table: `file_share_keys`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE file_share_keys (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    file_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    salt BLOB NOT NULL,                    -- 32-byte random salt for Argon2id
    encrypted_fek BLOB NOT NULL,           -- FEK encrypted with Argon2id-derived share key
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at DATETIME,                   -- Optional expiration
    access_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,       -- Track usage
    last_accessed DATETIME,               -- Last access timestamp
    FOREIGN KEY (file_id) REFERENCES files(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_file_share_keys_file_id ON file_share_keys(file_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_file_share_keys_expires_at ON file_share_keys(expires_at);
```

### Client-Side Implementation

**New WASM Functions for Share Access**
```javascript
// Argon2id derivation with specific parameters for share passwords
function deriveShareKey(sharePassword, salt) {
    return argon2id({
        password: sharePassword,
        salt: salt,
        memory: 128 * 1024,      // 128MB memory
        iterations: 4,           // 4 iterations  
        parallelism: 4,          // 4 threads
        hashLength: 32           // 32-byte output
    });
}

// Create share access (owner)
function createShareAccess(fileId, sharePassword) {
    // Generate random salt
    const salt = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32));
    
    // Derive share key using Argon2id
    const shareKey = deriveShareKey(sharePassword, salt);
    
    // Get owner's session key and decrypt FEK
    const sessionKey = getSecureSessionKey();
    const encryptedFEK = downloadFileFEK(fileId);
    const fek = decryptWithAES_GCM(encryptedFEK, sessionKey);
    
    // Encrypt FEK with share key
    const encryptedFEKShare = encryptWithAES_GCM(fek, shareKey);
    
    // Send to server
    return uploadShareAccess(fileId, salt, encryptedFEKShare);
}

// Access shared file (anonymous visitor)
function accessSharedFile(shareId, sharePassword) {
    // Download share metadata
    const shareData = downloadShareMetadata(shareId, sharePassword);
    
    // Derive share key using same parameters
    const shareKey = deriveShareKey(sharePassword, shareData.salt);
    
    // Decrypt FEK
    const fek = decryptWithAES_GCM(shareData.encrypted_fek, shareKey);
    
    // Download and decrypt file
    const encryptedFile = downloadFileBlob(shareData.download_url);
    const decryptedFile = decryptWithAES_GCM(encryptedFile, fek);
    
    return decryptedFile;
}
```

**Password Validation for Share Passwords**
```javascript
function validateSharePassword(password) {
    // Enhanced requirements for share passwords (18+ characters)
    const requirements = {
        minLength: 18,
        requireUppercase: true,
        requireLowercase: true, 
        requireDigits: true,
        requireSpecialChars: true,
        specialCharSet: "`~!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>?"
    };
    
    return validatePasswordComplexity(password, requirements);
}
```

### Server-Side Handler Implementation

**File Share Handler: `handlers/file_shares.go`**
```go
// CreateFileShare creates a new share access for a file
func (h *Handler) CreateFileShare(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Validate file ownership
    fileID := getFileIDFromPath(r)
    userID := getUserIDFromJWT(r)
    
    if !h.validateFileOwnership(fileID, userID) {
        http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", http.StatusForbidden)
        return
    }
    
    // Parse request
    var req CreateShareRequest
    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Invalid request", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    
    // Server never processes the share password - client sends only salt + encrypted FEK
    shareID := generateUUID()
    
    // Store share metadata in database
    share := FileShare{
        ID:           shareID,
        FileID:       fileID,
        Salt:         req.Salt,         // Random salt from client
        EncryptedFEK: req.EncryptedFEK, // FEK encrypted with Argon2id-derived key
        ExpiresAt:    calculateExpiration(req.ExpiresInDays),
        CreatedAt:    time.Now(),
    }
    
    if err := h.db.CreateFileShare(share); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Failed to create share", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    
    // Return share URL
    response := CreateShareResponse{
        Success:  true,
        ShareID:  shareID,
        ShareURL: fmt.Sprintf("%s/share/%s", h.config.BaseURL, shareID),
        ExpiresAt: share.ExpiresAt,
    }
    
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)
}

// AccessSharedFile provides share metadata for anonymous access
func (h *Handler) AccessSharedFile(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    shareID := getShareIDFromPath(r)
    sharePassword := r.Header.Get("X-Share-Password")
    
    if sharePassword == "" {
        http.Error(w, "Share password required", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    
    // Get share metadata from database
    share, err := h.db.GetFileShare(shareID)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Share not found", http.StatusNotFound)
        return
    }
    
    // Check expiration
    if share.ExpiresAt != nil && time.Now().After(*share.ExpiresAt) {
        http.Error(w, "Share expired", http.StatusGone)
        return
    }
    
    // Get file metadata
    file, err := h.db.GetFile(share.FileID)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "File not found", http.StatusNotFound)
        return
    }
    
    // Return share data (server never validates password - client does Argon2id derivation)
    response := ShareAccessResponse{
        Success:      true,
        Salt:         base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(share.Salt),
        EncryptedFEK: base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(share.EncryptedFEK),
        FileInfo: FileInfo{
            Filename:    file.Filename,
            Size:        file.Size,
            ContentType: file.ContentType,
        },
        DownloadURL: h.storage.GetFileURL(file.StorageID),
    }
    
    // Update access tracking
    h.db.IncrementShareAccess(shareID)
    
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)
}
```

### File Format Compatibility

**No Changes to Encrypted File Blobs**: The existing file encryption format remains unchanged. Files continue to be encrypted with FEKs and stored immutably in S3. Share access works by providing alternative decryption paths to the same FEK through the separate `file_share_keys` database table.

**Encryption Flow**:
1. **File Upload**: `File → AES-GCM(FEK) → Encrypted Blob → S3`
2. **FEK Storage**: `FEK → AES-GCM(SessionKey) → Database`
3. **Share Creation**: `FEK → AES-GCM(ShareKey) → file_share_keys table`

### Argon2id Configuration

**Production Parameters** (128MB memory, 4 iterations, 4 threads):
- **Memory Cost**: 131,072 KB (128MB) - Provides strong ASIC resistance
- **Time Cost**: 4 iterations - Balances security with usability (~500ms on modern hardware)
- **Parallelism**: 4 threads - Utilizes multi-core processors efficiently
- **Hash Length**: 32 bytes - Standard AES-256 key size
- **Salt Length**: 32 bytes - Prevents rainbow table attacks

**Client-Side Implementation**: Argon2id runs entirely in browser WASM, ensuring share passwords never leave the client in plaintext form.

## Updated Complete End-to-End Share System Flow Implementation: Cost/Benefit Analysis: Security & Privacy

### Security Benefits

**Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: The server maintains complete zero-knowledge properties by never processing share passwords in plaintext. All Argon2id derivation occurs client-side, with the server storing only random salts and encrypted FEKs that are computationally indistinguishable from random data without knowledge of the share password.

**ASIC-Resistant Protection**: Argon2id with 128MB memory requirements provides exceptional resistance to specialized hardware attacks. Unlike PBKDF2 or bcrypt, the memory-hard nature of Argon2id makes ASIC development prohibitively expensive, maintaining security advantages even against well-funded adversaries with custom silicon.

**Strong Entropy Requirements**: 18+ character passwords with complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters from "`~!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:,.<>?") provide approximately 65-70 bits of entropy for well-constructed passwords, remaining computationally infeasible to crack even with significant resources.

**Perfect Forward Secrecy for Account Files**: Non-shared files remain perfectly secure even under complete server compromise because they depend on OPAQUE export keys that cannot be derived from any stored data. This creates a two-tier security model where the most sensitive files (account-only) have maximum protection.

**Domain Separation**: Share keys use distinct Argon2id derivation contexts, preventing any cryptographic relationship between account passwords and share passwords, eliminating cross-contamination risks.

### Security Costs

**Offline Attack Vulnerability**: Shared files become susceptible to offline dictionary attacks if the database is compromised. Attackers with database access can attempt to crack share passwords by iteratively applying Argon2id to password candidates, though the 128MB memory requirement makes this computationally expensive.

**User Password Dependency**: Security is fundamentally limited by user behavior in choosing share passwords. Despite 18+ character requirements, users may choose predictable patterns or reuse passwords, potentially undermining the cryptographic protections.

**Computational Attack Economics**: While Argon2id provides strong protection, determined attackers with significant resources (estimated $100,000+ investment for specialized hardware) could potentially mount effective attacks against weaker share passwords within the 18-20 character range.

### Privacy Benefits

**Anonymous Access Model**: Recipients require no account creation, registration, or authentication with the service. This eliminates metadata collection about recipients and provides genuine anonymous file access that preserves recipient privacy completely.

**Client-Side Decryption**: All cryptographic operations occur in the recipient's browser, ensuring file contents never transit the server in plaintext form. The server acts purely as an encrypted blob storage system with no visibility into file contents.

**Out-of-Band Password Sharing**: Share passwords are communicated through separate channels (email, messaging, verbal), creating natural separation between access credentials and the storage system. This prevents the server from correlating access patterns with identity information.

**Minimal Metadata Storage**: The server stores only cryptographically necessary information (salts, encrypted FEKs) plus basic access tracking. No personal information, IP addresses, or detailed access logs are required for functionality.

### Privacy Costs

**Access Pattern Correlation**: Database records contain creation timestamps and access counts that could enable correlation attacks if multiple files are shared with the same password or if access patterns are distinctive.

**Browser Fingerprinting Risk**: Client-side Argon2id operations may create distinctive computational signatures that could potentially be used for device fingerprinting, though this risk is minimal compared to traditional web tracking.

**Temporal Analysis Vulnerability**: Share creation and access times stored in the database could enable traffic analysis attacks if combined with network monitoring, potentially revealing usage patterns.

### Operational Benefits

**Storage Efficiency**: No file re-encryption required when adding share access, as encrypted blobs remain immutable in S3. This provides significant bandwidth and storage cost savings, especially for large files.

**Scalable Share Management**: Multiple share passwords per file with independent expiration and access controls. Share revocation is instantaneous (database record deletion) without affecting file accessibility for other authorized users.

**Performance Optimization**: Share access incurs computational cost only during initial key derivation. Subsequent file access uses standard AES-GCM operations with acceptable performance characteristics.

**Infrastructure Simplicity**: No complex key escrow, secret sharing, or distributed key management required. The system maintains simplicity while providing robust security properties.

### Operational Costs

**Client Computation Burden**: Argon2id with 128MB memory requirement creates significant browser resource usage (500ms+ processing time, substantial memory allocation). This may impact user experience on low-end devices or slow connections.

**Browser Compatibility Requirements**: WASM-based Argon2id implementation requires modern browser support and may exclude users on legacy systems or restrictive environments.

**Support Complexity**: Users may experience confusion with computational delays, memory warnings, or device limitations when accessing shared files, potentially increasing support burden.

### Quantified Risk Assessment

**Database Breach + Weak Password Scenario**: 
- **Probability**: Moderate (assume 10% chance of database compromise over 5 years)  
- **Impact**: High for files with weak share passwords (<20 characters, common patterns)
- **Attack Cost**: $10,000-50,000 for GPU cluster to crack weak passwords within weeks
- **Mitigation**: 18+ character enforcement, password strength education, optional expiration

**Database Breach + Strong Password Scenario**:
- **Probability**: Same 10% database compromise risk
- **Impact**: Minimal for files with strong share passwords (20+ characters, high entropy)
- **Attack Cost**: $100,000+ for specialized hardware, months-to-years timeframe
- **Mitigation**: Strong passwords make attacks economically unfeasible for most threat actors

**Comparative Analysis**: This approach provides superior security to traditional shared link systems (which often use URL tokens vulnerable to log analysis) while maintaining zero-knowledge properties. The controlled risk exposure (opt-in per file, bounded by password strength) represents an optimal balance between security and usability for anonymous file sharing.

**Recommended Risk Tolerance**: Appropriate for files
