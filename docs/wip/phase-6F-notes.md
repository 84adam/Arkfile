# Phase 6F Development Reset & Deployment Notes

## Purpose & Context

This document tracks the development of an improved dev-reset workflow and database schema consolidation for the Arkfile project during Phase 6F implementation. The primary purpose is to create a reliable deployment and testing environment that will validate the complete Phase 6F functionality when it becomes fully operational.

## Dev-Reset Script Improvements

### Schema Consolidation Implementation

**Problem Addressed**: The application previously used separate schema files (`schema_extensions.sql` and `schema_rate_limiting.sql`) which caused complexity in database setup scripts and parsing issues.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Consolidated single schema file**: Merged all schema components into `database/schema_extensions.sql`
- ✅ **Removed separate rate limiting schema**: Deleted `database/schema_rate_limiting.sql` 
- ✅ **Updated database.go**: Modified `ApplyRateLimitingSchema()` to be backwards-compatible no-op
- ✅ **Simplified setup script**: Database setup now creates base tables then delegates extended schema to application startup

**Benefits**:
- Single authoritative source for complete database schema
- Eliminates complex SQL parsing in bash scripts
- Allows application's native schema handling to manage complex statements
- Reduces setup script complexity and potential parsing errors

### Enhanced Dev-Reset Workflow

**Script**: `scripts/dev-reset.sh`

**Complete Reset Process**:
1. **Service Shutdown**: Aggressively stops all arkfile services (arkfile, minio, rqlite, caddy)
2. **Data Destruction**: Completely removes all user data, database, logs, secrets, and cryptographic keys
3. **Fresh Build**: Rebuilds application directly in current directory including:
   - TypeScript frontend compilation with Bun
   - WebAssembly build for crypto operations
   - Go application build with proper library linking
4. **Secret Generation**: Creates fresh JWT secrets, rqlite authentication, and configuration
5. **Service Startup**: Starts MinIO, rqlite with leader establishment verification
6. **Database Schema**: Applies base schema via improved setup script
7. **Application Launch**: Attempts to start arkfile service

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ **Direct build approach**: Builds in development directory instead of complex deployment
- ✅ **Complete secret regeneration**: Fresh secrets on every reset
- ✅ **Comprehensive data wipe**: Ensures no state persists between resets
- ✅ **Service verification**: Waits for rqlite leadership establishment
- ✅ **Improved error handling**: Better feedback during each phase

## ✅ RESOLVED: Database Schema & Deployment Issues

### Unified Schema Implementation - COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND DEPLOYED**

**Final Solution**: Replaced fragile multi-step schema approach with single unified schema file.

**Implementation Details**:
- ✅ **Created `database/unified_schema.sql`**: Complete 350+ line schema with proper dependency ordering
- ✅ **Updated `database/database.go`**: Single schema execution instead of multi-step approach  
- ✅ **Removed legacy `access_logs` table**: Eliminated redundant table (unused in greenfield app)
- ✅ **Fixed rqlite compatibility**: TEXT fields instead of JSON, proper BLOB support
- ✅ **Updated dev-reset script**: Now deploys unified schema to `/opt/arkfile/database/`

**Root Cause Analysis**: The original multi-step database approach was fundamentally flawed:
- Complex SQL statement splitting by semicolons broke on triggers and views
- Dependency ordering issues with indexes being created before tables
- Partial failure scenarios left incomplete database state
- Unnecessary "legacy compatibility" elements in greenfield application

**Success Verification**:
```
2025/08/05 09:42:02 Loading unified database schema from: database/unified_schema.sql
2025/08/05 09:42:02 Successfully applied complete unified database schema
```

**Application Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- HTTP endpoint: http://localhost:8080 ✅ responding
- HTTPS endpoint: https://localhost:4443 ✅ responding  
- Health check: `{"status":"ok"}` ✅ working
- All services running stable: arkfile, minio, rqlite ✅

### Dev-Reset Script - FULLY UPDATED

**Status**: ✅ **WORKING PERFECTLY WITH UNIFIED SCHEMA**

**Key Updates Applied**:
- ✅ **Schema deployment**: Creates `/opt/arkfile/database/` and copies `unified_schema.sql`
- ✅ **Eliminated old database setup**: Removed dependency on fragile bash SQL parsing
- ✅ **Application-managed schema**: Database initialization handled by arkfile service on startup
- ✅ **Complete reset verification**: Successfully tested full reset cycle

**Deployment Flow**:
1. ✅ Services stopped and data wiped
2. ✅ Application built with unified schema support  
3. ✅ Binary and schema deployed to `/opt/arkfile/`
4. ✅ Services started successfully
5. ✅ Unified schema applied automatically on startup
6. ✅ All endpoints responding correctly

## ✅ BREAKTHROUGH: Development Iteration Performance Issue RESOLVED

### Major Performance Optimization - COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE SOLVED**

**Problem**: The dev-reset script was rebuilding libopaque libraries on every run, causing 5-10 minute delays and thrashing during development iteration.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- `go mod vendor` was running on every build, overwriting compiled libopaque `.so` files with source-only submodules
- The existing `SKIP_C_LIBS` logic was being bypassed because `go mod vendor` would destroy the libraries before the check
- No caching mechanism existed to detect when dependency sync was actually needed

**Solution Implemented**: ✅ **INTELLIGENT VENDOR CACHING SYSTEM**

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# Smart vendor directory sync - only when dependencies actually change
VENDOR_CACHE=".vendor_cache"
CURRENT_HASH=$(sha256sum go.sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
CACHED_HASH=$(cat "$VENDOR_CACHE" 2>/dev/null || echo "")

if [ "$CURRENT_HASH" = "$CACHED_HASH" ] && [ -d "vendor" ]; then
    echo "✅ Vendor directory matches go.sum, skipping sync (preserves compiled libraries)"
else
    echo "Dependencies changed or vendor missing, syncing vendor directory..."
    go mod vendor
    echo "$CURRENT_HASH" > "$VENDOR_CACHE"
fi
```

**Performance Results**:
- **First run**: Dependencies sync + libopaque compilation (several minutes)
- **Subsequent runs**: ✅ **16 seconds total** (skips both vendor sync and compilation)

**Verification Evidence**:

**Before Fix (every run)**:
```
Dependencies changed or vendor missing, syncing vendor directory...
[Full libopaque compilation with gcc warnings - 3-5 minutes]
✅ C dependencies built successfully
```

**After Fix (subsequent runs)**:
```
✅ Vendor directory matches go.sum, skipping sync (preserves compiled libraries)  
✅ Using existing C dependencies
real    0m16.502s
```

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `scripts/setup/build.sh`: Added intelligent vendor caching logic
- ✅ `.gitignore`: Added `.vendor_cache` to ignore list

### Final Resolution Status: COMPLETE

**All Previous Issues**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
- ✅ Database schema consolidation: Working perfectly

- **Preserved compiled libraries**: No unnecessary recompilation
- **Intelligent dependency management**: Only rebuilds when actually needed
- **Streamlined workflow**: Simple `sudo ./scripts/dev-reset.sh` → working system in 16 seconds

## Schema Components Successfully Consolidated

**Base Tables** (created by setup script):
- `users` - User account management
- `file_metadata` - File information and metadata
- `user_activity` - User action logging
- `access_logs` - Access logging
- `admin_logs` - Administrative action logs

**Extended Tables** (created by application on startup):
- `file_share_keys` - Anonymous share system with Argon2id protection
- `share_access_attempts` - EntityID-based rate limiting
- `security_events` - Security event logging with privacy protection
- `rate_limit_state` - Rate limiting state management
- `opaque_server_keys` - OPAQUE authentication server keys
- `opaque_user_data` - OPAQUE user registration data
- `upload_sessions` - Chunked upload session management
- `file_encryption_keys` - File encryption key management
- `refresh_tokens` - JWT refresh token management
- `revoked_tokens` - JWT token revocation list

**Additional Components**:
- Complete index set for performance optimization
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates
- Views for monitoring rate limiting activity
- Foreign key relationships for data integrity

## Integration with Phase 6F

**Purpose**: This dev-reset workflow will be essential for Phase 6F validation because:

1. **Clean Testing Environment**: Provides guaranteed clean state for each test cycle
2. **Complete Functionality Validation**: Will test entire system including database schema, authentication, and share system
3. **Deployment Readiness**: Ensures production deployment process works correctly
4. **Regression Prevention**: Allows testing that Phase 6F changes don't break existing functionality

**Next Phase**: Once the current environment/service issues are resolved, this reset workflow will enable comprehensive Phase 6F testing and validation of the complete user interface implementation.
