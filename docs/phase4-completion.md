### Testing Infrastructure

#### Comprehensive Integration Testing Suite
```bash
# Location: scripts/integration-test.sh (Enhanced in Phase 4)
# New Dual-Mode Operation:

# Mode 1: Testing Only (Default)
./scripts/integration-test.sh
# - Runs complete test suite without system modifications
# - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines and development validation
# - Tests deployment scripts in dry-run mode

# Mode 2: Full System Setup (Production)
./scripts/integration-test.sh
# When prompted, type "YES" for complete system setup:
# - Creates arkfile system user and group
# - Sets up complete directory structure with proper permissions  
# - Generates OPAQUE server keys
# - Generates JWT signing keys
# - Generates TLS certificates
# - Runs complete test suite (100+ tests)
# - Validates entire deployment

# Features:
- Complete OPAQUE registration and login flows
- Multi-device profile testing (minimal, interactive, balanced, maximum)
- Error handling and edge case validation
- Performance baseline measurement
- Cross-browser WebAssembly compatibility
- One-command production deployment capability
```

#### Enhanced Integration Test Script
The integration test script now provides enterprise-grade deployment automation:

```bash
⚠️  SYSTEM SETUP OPTION
This script can run in two modes:
1. Testing only (default) - Run tests without modifying system
2. Full setup - Create arkfile user, directories, and complete deployment

WARNING: Full setup will make system changes including:
• Creating 'arkfile' system user and group
• Creating directories in /opt/arkfile and /etc/arkfile
• Setting up proper permissions and ownership
• Installing systemd service files

Do you want to perform FULL SYSTEM SETUP? (type YES to confirm):
```
