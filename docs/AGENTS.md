# Arkfile: Overview for Agents

Arkfile is designed as a Zero-Knowledge File Vault over S3. It enables file backup for file owners, with client-side encryption happening via Go/WASM in browsers or using the `cryptocli` tool on the command-line (prior to uploading with `arkfile-client` to the server). It uses Minio as a gateway to interface with any number of backend storage systems that are S3 compatible in order to store client-side encrypted files.

It is vital to maintain the Zero-Knowledge design of the app and to preserve and protect user privacy end-to-end in all the work that we do.

We use OPAQUE for authentication, so that passwords are never sent to the server for logging in.

And we use client-side encryption to ensure that file data is never sent to the server until and unless it is encrypted with a strong password.

And we use client-side encryption to encrypt file metadata as well, including the original filename and the original sha256 digest of the original file.

And we never log IP addresses or any PII of users or visitors to the app/site. (e.g. visitor IP addresses are not logged and are obfuscated with HMAC to form an EntityID for select areas that need rate-limiting, such as to protect against shared file URL enumeration type attacks.)

The server must know nothing about the nature of the data belonging to clients, nor about their passwords, nor visitor IPs.

## Greenfield App

There are no current deployments of this app anywhere at present. No need to build in "backwards compatibility" at this stage when refactoring. The focus at this stage is on fixing and proving the correct implementation of the system as it is designed and intended.

## Function Review Sanity Checks

- Is this function required?
- Is it implemented in a standard and secure way?
- Is it merely a stub function or otherwise incomplete?
- Is it well placed, in the right file or area of the app?
- Does it require additional review, updates, moving or potentially deletion?
- Does it align with the vision and intended design of the app as being zero-knowledge and privacy preserving for users end-to-end?

## Key Tools for Development

In order to slowly build up the core functionality of the system and prove its correct and secure implementation, the following tools are critical to use, improve upon and maintain:

- `sudo bash /scripts/dev-reset.sh` - This tool peforms a full recompilation of the app, including static-linking of OPAQUE Auth libraries, and redeploys the app and starts app services, including the local Minio server used for testing and rqlite for the database. We should use `dev-reset.sh` every time we make a change to the app itself, in order to redeploy it consistently. Do not attempt to rebuild the app using any other build scripts or manual compilation commands, including for the CLI utils written in Go. `dev-reset.sh` does all of this for you. Use it every time.

- `sudo bash /scripts/testing/test-app-curl.sh` - This is the main testing script used for proving out the correct implementation and functionality of the system via in-depth, end-to-end testing of all critical app functions using a combination of `curl` and `arkfile-client` and `cryptocli`. This script is the main way that we demonstrate that the app does what it is designed to do right now. `test-app-curl.sh` must not be used immediately after changes have been made to the app itself; instead use `dev-reset.sh` first, then run the test script.

## No Emojis

None of this stuff: "üéâüöÄ‚ùåüì¶‚ö†Ô∏è‚úÖ". I don't want it in responses, nor in comments, nor in code. Nowhere. We are not middle school girls. Instead of '‚ùå' use [X]. Instead of '‚úÖ' use [OK]. Instead of '‚ö†Ô∏è' use [!]. Instead of 'üéâ'/'üöÄ' use 'SUCCESS!' or something to that effect.
