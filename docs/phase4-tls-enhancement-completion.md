- **RSA 4096-bit** as automatic fallback for compatibility
- **SHA-384** signatures for enhanced security
- **TLS 1.3** preferred, TLS 1.2 minimum support

### 2. Enterprise Certificate Architecture ‚úÖ

## Technical Implementation Details

### OpenSSL 3.x Compatibility Resolution

**Before (Broken):**
```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkcs8 -out key.pem  # ‚ùå Deprecated
```

**After (Modern):**
```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-384 -out key.pem  # ‚úÖ Modern
```

### Certificate Generation Improvements

**Algorithm Selection Logic:**
1. **Primary**: Try ECDSA P-384 (modern, efficient)
2. **Fallback**: Use RSA 4096-bit (compatibility)
3. **Validation**: Test algorithm support before use
4. **Reporting**: Clear indication of algorithm used

**Certificate Extensions:**
```
Basic Constraints: CA:FALSE
Key Usage: Digital Signature, Key Encipherment, Key Agreement  
Extended Key Usage: Server Authentication, Client Authentication
Subject Alternative Name: DNS.1=domain, IP.1=127.0.0.1
```

### Certificate Lifecycle Automation

**Expiration Monitoring:**
- 30-day warning threshold (configurable)
- Automatic renewal detection
- Service restart coordination
- Backup and rollback capability

**Renewal Process:**
1. Check certificate expiration
2. Create automatic backup
3. Generate new certificates
4. Validate new certificates
5. Restart affected services
6. Verify system health
