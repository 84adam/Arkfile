- ✅ Generates OPAQUE and JWT keys
- ✅ Starts all services with proper TLS configuration
- ✅ Verifies service connectivity and health endpoints

### Issue Identified: Missing Admin Validation Instructions

**Problem:** The integration test reaches "COMPLETE" status but provides no guidance for administrators to verify that the system is actually working correctly with real-world operations.

**Solution:** Enhanced admin testing procedures with step-by-step validation.

## Detailed Admin Testing Guide for COMPLETE Mode

When the integration test reports "COMPLETE", administrators should follow these validation procedures:

### Step 1: Verify Service Status

```bash
# Check all services are running
sudo systemctl status arkfile
sudo systemctl status caddy
sudo systemctl status minio@default
sudo systemctl status rqlite@default

# Verify network connectivity
curl -k https://localhost:8080/health
curl -k https://localhost:9000/minio/health/live
```

### Step 2: Admin Registration and Authentication

```bash
# 1. Open web browser to https://localhost:8080
# 2. Click "Register" link
# 3. Register with admin credentials:
#    Email: admin@example.com
#    Password: AdminPassword123!
#    (Use a strong password in production)

# 4. Verify OPAQUE authentication:
#    - Registration should complete without errors
#    - Login should work immediately after registration
#    - No password storage warnings should appear
```

### Step 3: Admin Panel Access Verification

```bash
# 1. After login, navigate to https://localhost:8080/admin
# 2. Verify admin panel loads correctly
# 3. Check user management functions:
#    - View registered users
#    - Approve/unapprove users (if applicable)
#    - View system statistics

# 4. Test admin-only features:
#    - System health dashboard
#    - User activity logs
#    - Storage usage monitoring
```

### Step 4: File Upload and Encryption Testing

```bash
# 1. Create test files of various sizes:
echo "Small test file" > /tmp/small_test.txt
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/large_test.bin bs=1M count=10

# 2. Upload via web interface:
#    - Navigate to https://localhost:8080
#    - Use "Upload File" functionality
#    - Test both small and large files
#    - Verify encryption indicators appear
#    - Confirm upload success messages

# 3. Download and verify:
#    - Download previously uploaded files
#    - Verify files match original content
#    - Test file sharing functionality (if enabled)
```

### Step 5: OPAQUE System Health Validation

```bash
# Use the cryptocli tool for detailed system validation
cd /opt/arkfile  # or wherever arkfile is installed

# Build and run health checks
go build ./cmd/cryptocli
./cryptocli health -detailed

# Expected output should show:
# ✅ OPAQUE server initialized: PASS
# ✅ Database connectivity: PASS  
# ✅ Key material loaded: PASS
# ✅ Protocol negotiation: PASS
# ✅ Capability detection: PASS
# Overall Status: HEALTHY

# Test additional capabilities
./cryptocli capability -detailed
./cryptocli pq-status
```

### Step 6: Multi-User Authentication Testing

```bash
# 1. Register additional test users:
#    - testuser1@example.com
#    - testuser2@example.com
#    - Use different passwords for each

# 2. Test cross-user scenarios:
#    - Login as different users
#    - Verify user isolation (users can't see each other's files)
#    - Test user approval workflow (if admin approval required)

# 3. Verify OPAQUE authentication properties:
#    - No password exposure in browser developer tools
#    - No credential stuffing vulnerability
#    - Proper session management
```

### Step 7: Storage Backend Validation

```bash
# Verify MinIO integration
mc alias set local https://localhost:9000 arkfile arkfile123

# List uploaded files (should see encrypted content)
mc ls local/uploads/

# Verify files are properly encrypted (should not be readable)
mc cat local/uploads/[some-file-id] | head -20
# Output should be encrypted binary data

# Test storage quotas and limits
mc admin info local
```

### Step 8: Database and Logging Verification

```bash
# Check rqlite database content
curl -s -X POST https://localhost:4001/db/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"queries": ["SELECT email, is_admin, created_at FROM users"]}' \
  -u arkfile:rqlite123

# Verify security event logging
sudo journalctl -u arkfile -f --no-pager | grep -i "authentication\|login\|security"

# Check audit logs exist and are properly formatted
ls -la /var/log/arkfile/
tail -20 /var/log/arkfile/security-events.log
```

### Step 9: TLS and Security Validation

```bash
# Verify TLS certificates are valid
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8080 -servername localhost

# Test security headers
curl -s -I https://localhost:8080/ | grep -i "security\|strict\|x-frame\|x-content"

# Verify HTTPS enforcement
curl -I http://localhost:8080/ | grep -i "location.*https"
```

### Step 10: Performance and Load Testing (Optional)

```bash
# Basic load testing with ab (Apache Bench)
ab -n 100 -c 10 https://localhost:8080/

# Test file upload performance
time curl -X POST -F "file=@/tmp/large_test.bin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [jwt-token]" \
  https://localhost:8080/api/upload

# Monitor resource usage during testing
htop  # or equivalent system monitor
```

## Expected Results and Troubleshooting
