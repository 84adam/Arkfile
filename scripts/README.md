# Arkfile Scripts Guide

This directory contains all the setup, maintenance, and testing scripts for Arkfile. This guide helps you understand which script to run for your specific needs.

## üöÄ New to Arkfile? Start Here

### One-Command Setup
```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh
```
**What it does:** Sets up a complete working Arkfile system for testing/development
- Creates users, directories, and cryptographic keys
- Sets up local MinIO storage and rqlite database
- Starts all services and validates they're working
- Provides web interface URL and testing instructions

**Use this if:** You want to try Arkfile immediately without complex configuration.

## üéØ Common Scenarios

### I Want to Try Arkfile (Development/Testing)
```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh
```

### I Need Production Deployment
```bash
# Step 1: Foundation
./scripts/setup-foundation.sh

# Step 2: Services  
sudo ./scripts/setup-minio.sh
sudo ./scripts/setup-rqlite.sh

# Step 3: Validate
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh
```

### I'm Setting Up CI/CD
```bash
./scripts/test-only.sh --skip-performance
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/integration-test.sh
```

### Something's Not Working
```bash
./scripts/health-check.sh
./scripts/security-audit.sh
sudo journalctl -u arkfile -f
```

### I Need to Backup/Rotate Keys
```bash
./scripts/backup-keys.sh
./scripts/rotate-jwt-keys.sh
```

### I Want to Remove Arkfile
```bash
sudo ./scripts/uninstall.sh
```
**Note:** Interactive script with prompts for each component. Offers key backup before removal.

## üîß Script Options

Most scripts support help flags:
```bash
./scripts/script-name.sh --help
```

Common options:
- `--skip-tests` - Skip test execution
- `--skip-tls` - Skip TLS certificate generation
- `--force-rebuild` - Force rebuild even if exists
- `--verbose` - Detailed output

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Sudo Requirements
Scripts that modify system configuration require sudo:
- User/group creation scripts
- Service setup scripts  
- Key management scripts

### File Permissions
All scripts maintain production-security file permissions:
- Private keys: 600 (owner read/write only)
- Directories: 750 (owner full, group read/execute)
- Public files: 644 (owner read/write, others read)

### Service Dependencies
Some scripts have dependencies:
- MinIO setup requires rqlite
- Application requires both MinIO and rqlite
- TLS certificates are optional for development

## üÜò Getting Help

### Script-Specific Help
```bash
./scripts/script-name.sh --help

### System Status
```bash
./scripts/health-check.sh
sudo systemctl status arkfile
```

### Logs
```bash
