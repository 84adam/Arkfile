# Arkfile

*s3-style encrypted file sharing and backup*

## What is Arkfile?

Arkfile is an open-source file storage and sharing platform that uses zero-knowledge encryption. Zero-knowledge means that files are encrypted on your device before being uploaded, so the server never has access to your unencrypted data or encryption keys. This ensures that your files remain private even from the service provider.

Encrypted files are then stored on any one of the multiple S3-type storage backends supported, such as Backblaze B2, Wasabi, Vultr Object Storage, or a self-hosted MinIO instance. All of the storage backends provide redundancy across multiple drives and geographic locations for high data availability.

Arkfile includes a multi-key system that allows you to create additional decryption keys for specific files. This enables secure file sharing without revealing your primary password. You can generate sharing links with independent passwords, set expiration dates, and add password hints while avoiding file duplication.

The platform is open-source to allow security audits and customization. It supports distributed deployments for organizations requiring scalable file storage and sharing capabilities. Arkfile uses rqlite for database redundancy and scaling, automatically providing distributed consensus across nodes. When using MinIO as a storage backend, you can add as many nodes as needed, with each node automatically getting its own rqlite instance for high availability.

## Quick Start

**Want to try Arkfile immediately?** Run this single command:

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh
```

This will set up a complete working Arkfile system with:
- Local MinIO storage
- Single-node rqlite database  
- Web interface at http://localhost:8080

## Storage Providers

Arkfile supports multiple storage backends:

- **Local MinIO** (Default for demo) - Uses MinIO in filesystem mode
- **Backblaze B2** - Cost-effective cloud storage with global CDN
- **Wasabi** - High-performance S3-compatible storage
- **Vultr Object Storage** - Developer-friendly with simple pricing
- **MinIO Cluster** - Self-hosted distributed storage

Configure your preferred provider by setting `STORAGE_PROVIDER` in your environment configuration. See `.env.example` for provider-specific settings.
