## What is Arkfile?

**Arkfile: Client-Side Encrypted Cloud Storage with Secure File Sharing**

Arkfile is an open-source, privacy-focused file storage and sharing platform that addresses the fundamental security concerns inherent in traditional cloud storage services. The system implements a zero-trust architecture where sensitive documents and media files undergo client-side encryption before transmission, ensuring that even the service provider cannot access user data.

The core innovation lies in Arkfile's dual-layer security model. When users upload files, the system employs strong cryptographic algorithms to encrypt data locally within the user's browser environment before any network transmission occurs. This encrypted payload is then stored on enterprise-grade distributed storage systems that implement redundancy across multiple physical drives and geographic locations. The underlying storage infrastructure is configurable by administrators, supporting various redundant storage backends including Backblaze B2, Wasabi, Vultr Object Storage, or self-hosted MinIO clusters that can withstand multiple simultaneous drive failures while maintaining data availability.

The platform addresses the challenge of secure file sharing through an innovative multi-key encryption system. Rather than compromising security by sharing primary passwords, users can generate additional decryption keys for specific files. This allows the creation of secure sharing links with independent passwords, enabling controlled access without exposing the user's master credentials. The system supports granular access controls, including configurable expiration dates and password hints, while maintaining storage efficiency by avoiding file duplication.

The platform's transparent design philosophy extends to its open-source codebase, allowing security audits and customization while maintaining enterprise-grade deployment practices. This combination of cryptographic rigor, operational reliability, and architectural transparency makes Arkfile suitable for individuals and organizations requiring verifiable security for sensitive file storage and sharing workflows.
